Don't worry, about a thing
'Cause every little thing, gonna be all right
Singin', don't worry, about a thing
'Cause every little thing, gonna be all right
Rise up this mornin'
Smile with the risin' sun
Three little birds
Pitched by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Sayin', "This is my message to you, whoo-hoo"
Singin', don't worry, about a thing
'Cause every little thing, is gonna be all right
Singin', don't worry, don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing, gonna be all right
Rise up this mornin'
Smile with the risin' sun
Three little birds
Pitched by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Sayin', "This is my message to you, whoo-hoo"
Singin', don't worry, about a thing
Worry about a thing, no
Every little thing, gonna be all right
Don't worry
Singin', don't worry, about a thing
I won't worry!
'Cause every little thing, gonna be alright
Hmm, don't worry, about a thing
'Cause a every little thing, gonna be all right
I won't worry
Baby don't worry, about a thing
'Cause every little thing, is gonna be all right
Say, don't worry about a thing, no girl
'Cause every little thing gonna be all right
